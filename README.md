## Problem Statement

Remaining productive is a constant challenge in our distraction-filled world. With smartphones at the center of our daily routines, it's increasingly difficult to stay focused and committed to our tasks. Consider these challenges:

- **Ubiquitous Distractions:**

  Our phones, while incredibly useful, often pull us away from important tasks with endless notifications and temptations.

- **Commitment Struggles:**

  Whether you're a student or a professional, maintaining concentration amid constant interruptions is no easy feat.

- **The Need for a Focus Tool:**

  There's a clear demand for an application that not only minimizes distractions but also motivates users to stay on track.

## Our Solution: FrogIn

A blend of the word "Frog" and the phrase "lock in": FrogIn is a mobile application designed to help you regain control of your focus and productivity. Here’s how it works:

### Key Features

**1. Scheduled Distraction Lock:**
   - Set a timer to lock your phone for a user-defined period.
   - During this period, your device won’t receive notifications or allow you to switch screens, keeping you fully engaged.

**2. Gamified Commitment:**
   - Start the timer and receive a frog egg.
   - As you remain committed, watch your egg mature into a thriving frog.
   - If you break your focus, the frog’s journey ends prematurely.

**3. Personal Pond:**
   - Collect and showcase your frogs in a personal "pond".
   - Track your progress and celebrate your successes as your pond fills with the fruits of your dedication.
