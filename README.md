# FrogIn

## Problem Statement
Remaining productive in life is as fickle as always, so why not focus up with the help of a little
application? Introducing, FrogIn a portmanteau of Frog and the colloquial phrase “lock in”
meaning “to get focused and commit to something”. FrogIn will aid not only students around
the globe but also the everyday man who wishes to concentrate and complete the tasks they
have set for themselves. We all had our moments where we desire to put aside the major distraction we all now carry with us: our phones. As such, we seek to put forward a mobile application that solves this.

## Solution
We hope to create an application that would remove distractions posed by our mobile devices
by essentially locking the phone for a set amount of time dictated by the user. During this
time, the phone will be unable to receive notifications or swap to a different screen bar for
emergencies. Users will be incentivised to see through their dedication by way of gamification.
When they start the timer, they will be given a frog egg, which over the course of the timer,
will mature and grow into fully fledged adults! However, should the user abscond their
commitment, the frog will sadly pass away instead. Users will be able to collect and display
the various frogs collected in a personal “pond” where the frogs will live.
